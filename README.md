3.	Job Level Distribution:
-	Level 1: 543 employees (highest count).
-	Level 2: 534 employees (second-highest count).
-	Levels 3-5 have significantly fewer employees, indicating a pyramid-like structure.
4.	Tenure Analysis: Employees with 5 years of service are the largest group (196), followed by those with 1 year (171).
5.	Layoff Insights: The layoff rate is 8% (117 employees), with the research and development department having the highest layoff count (74).
6.	Satisfaction Levels: Employees with high job satisfaction are 569, while low satisfaction impacts 442 employees, potentially contributing to turnover.
7.	Distance Status:
-	63.95% of employees are "very close" to the workplace.
